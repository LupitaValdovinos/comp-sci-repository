    <h2 id="about"> ABOUT ME!</h2>
    <h3>WHO AM I?!</h3>
    <p>Hello!My name is Lupita Valdovinos. I am a sophomore<br> and attend Summit Preoporatory Highschool. I am currently 15<br>years old. I love hearing music. Whenever you see me I will be<br>hearing my music or be on my phone.</p>
    <h3>FUN FACTS ABOUT ME!</h3>
    <p>My favorite movie is Red Dawn, Maze Runner, and Perks of Being<br> a Wallflower. I love these movies so much because I am really into<br> action movies. Although one of them is not action the movie is just<br> amazing and full of meaningful ideas. My favorite book is "The<br>Child Called It". That is my favorite book because it talks about a foster kid<br> that goes through a lot of families and none of them give him the little<br> attention he is asking for, but he never gives up. Everytime I read that book I<br> always get emotional and it always gives me the motivation to never give up. 
    <h3>Hobbies!</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite hobby is to write. When im bored and alone I get my notebook<br> start writing what is on my mind. Sometimes I get suprised of what write down.<br> The reason why I like doing this is because I get to get things off my head. I<br> began when I was in middle school and I never really considered it a hobby<br> until my freshman year. I took a creative writing class for my expedition class. That<br> class helped me a lot by showing me easier and different ways to espress my ideas and<br> transfer them into really good piece of writing.
